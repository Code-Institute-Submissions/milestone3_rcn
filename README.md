# The Royal College of Nursing Member Query Database

[Open in GitHub](https://github.com/H4RP3RK/milestone3_rcn)

</div>

The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) is a professional body and trade union for nursing staff in the UK. It is a membership organisation that provides advice and support on workplace and professional nursing issues. 
The RCN Member Query Database is a website/app created with the primary goal of improving communication and transparency between RCN staff and RCN members.

The website/app features...

The client requested this website to address a number of issues with their current methods of communication with its members. Up until now, RCN members have mainly used phone or email to contact the RCN. RCN staff would then respond by phone, email or, in some cases, a face-to-face meeting would be arranged.
Queries could require only one response or more complicated matters could require ongoing correspondence for many weeks or months. It may also require the RCN contacting third parties on behalf of the member. RCN staff are responsible for keeping a record of all interactions with members and third parties on an internal database. 
This database can be viewed by RCN staff but not by RCN members.

## Mandatory Requirements
A project violating any of these requirements will FAIL

- Data handling: Build a MongoDB-backed Flask project for a web application that allows users to store and manipulate data records about a particular domain. If you are considering using a different database, please discuss that with your mentor first and inform Student Care.
- Database structure: Put some effort into designing a database structure well-suited for your domain. Make sure to put some thought into the nesting relationships between records of different entities.
- User functionality: Create functionality for users to create, locate, display, edit and delete records (CRUD functionality).
- Use of technologies: Use HTML and custom CSS for the website's front-end.
- Structure: Incorporate a main navigation menu and structured layout (you might want to use Materialize or Bootstrap to accomplish this).
- Documentation: Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the value that it provides to its users.
- Version control: Use Git & GitHub for version control.
- Attribution: Maintain clear separation between code written by you and code from external sources (e.g. libraries or tutorials). Attribute any code from external sources to its source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README.
- Deployment: Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as Heroku.
- Make sure to not include any passwords or secret keys in the project repository.
- Important Notes - No authentication is expected for this project. The focus is on the data, rather than any business logic.
