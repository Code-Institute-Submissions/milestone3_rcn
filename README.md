# The Royal College of Nursing Member Query Database

[Open in GitHub](https://github.com/H4RP3RK/milestone3_rcn)

</div>

The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) is a professional body and trade union for nursing staff in the UK. It is a membership organisation that provides advice and support on workplace and professional nursing issues. 
The RCN Member Query Database is a website/app created with the primary goal of improving communication and transparency between RCN staff and RCN members. It is intended to be used by both RCN members and RCN staff.

The website/app has a number of features, some of which are only accessible to particular user groups. For all users, there is a login and registration page, a home page with details of the user's account details and the ability to edit these account details.
RCN members are also able to ask a question using an online form and access details of the questions they have asked, including the RCN staff leading on the question response. The member can add additional contacts onto the question, if they would like to add follow up questions/comments.
RCN staff can also add contacts onto questions members have created. RCN staff have additional accessability to see all questions asked by any member, assign the question to themselves or other staff and close the question. They are also able to see a list of all RCN members, their account details and questions they have asked.

The client requested this website to address issues with current methods of communication with its members. Up until now, RCN members have mainly used phone or email to contact the RCN. RCN staff would then respond by phone, email or, in some cases, a face-to-face meeting would be arranged. Member queries can differ in complexity. 
Some matters can be resolved with only one response but more complicated matters could require ongoing correspondence for many weeks or months. It may also require the RCN contacting third parties on behalf of the member. RCN staff are responsible for keeping a record of all interactions with members and third parties on an internal database. 
This database can be viewed by RCN staff but not by RCN members. It is expected that RCN members keep their own records of their ongoing cases or simply remember the information provided to them.
This leaves room for misunderstandings and misinterpretation of information in what can often be complicated and high stakes matters. In order to reduce this risk, RCN staff are encouraged to follow up telephone calls and face-to-face meetings with an email that confirms the advice given and actions agreed. This approach is followed sporadically by RCN staff.

The client goals for this new website/app are to:
* Improve communication and transparency between RCN staff and RCN members.
* Enhance the member experience in the hope of recruiting and retaining more members.
* Mitigate the organisation against misinterpretation of advice.
* Reduce the duplication of work and use of emails by RCN staff.
* Increase the consistency of record keeping.

The user goals for the new website/app are to:
* Easily seek advice and support from the RCN.
* Ensure that queries and advice are fully understood by both parties.
* Keep a record of previous advice that can be readily accessed at a later date.
* Track the progress of long-running cases.
* Reduce the need for email correspondence.

## User experience

### Target Audience

There are two target audiences for the RCN app - RCN members and RCN staff 

RCN members are:
* Nursing staff or nursing students.
* Practicing or studying in the UK.
* Ranging in age from 18 to 70 years old.
* In need of advice or support with a workplace or professional nursing issue.

RCN staff are:
* Employed by the RCN.
* May also be trained nurses.
* Ranging in age from 18 to 70 years old.
* Trained in the use of IT systems and databases.

### User Journey

An RCN member is expected to use the website/app in the following way:
1. Go to the website/app to write and submit their question.
2. The question is logged on member's home page.
3. The member can check the question details, including the details of the RCN Lead for their question, the response to their question and/or any work the RCN Lead has undertaken to resolve their question.
4. The member can choose to ask follow up questions by adding a new contact to their question.
5. Details of questions they have asked are logged on their home page, so can be consulted again at a later date.

An RCN staff member is expected to use the website/app in the following way:
1. Check the website/app for questions that have been asked by RCN members.
2. Assign questions to themself or the most appropriate RCN staff.
3. Questions assigned to the user are logged on the staff member's home page.
4. Respond to the question by adding a contact under the question details.
5. Log any additional contacts with third parties as a contact on the question, so the member is aware of the contact and can read the details.
6. Once the question has been answered, close the question.
7. All member accounts are listed so all staff can see member's accounts and their question details.

### User Aim 

RCN members visit this website/app because they want to:
* Ask for advice and support from the RCN.
* Remind themselves of previous advice given to them by the RCN.
* Check the progress of their ongoing case.

RCN staff use the database because they want to:
* Respond to a member's query in writing.
* Record a telephone or face-to-face meeting with the member or third party.
* Check back on the details of a member's case.

This website/app helps the users achieve these goals by providing:
* An easily accessible way for RCN members to get in touch with the RCN.
* An intuitive form of record keeping for both RCN staff and RCN members.
* A place to store previous RCN advice and information.
* A regularly updated log of ongoing cases.

## Features 
Every page has a consistent layout and design, which features:
* Headers and footers coloured blue and white, in line with the RCN brand.
* The RCN logo is in the top left corner of the header, in keeping with the layout of existing [RCN websites](https://www.rcn.org.uk/).
* A drop down navigation menu is used to minimise clutter on the page. The navigation menu differs, dependent on whether the user is a member or staff.
* There is a banner across each page with a title that clearly explains the page's purpose.
* The footer features links to related sites and their associated logos. On the left side of the footer there are the RCN sites; [RCN Website](https://www.rcn.org.uk/), [RCNi](https://rcni.com/) and [RCNXtra](https://my.rcn.org.uk/RCNXtra/login).
* On the right hand side of the footer, there are links to the RCN's social media sites; [Twitter](https://twitter.com/theRCN), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/index.php?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Froyalcollegeofnursing), [Instgram](https://www.instagram.com/thercn/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/RCNonline)
* Breadcrumbs are used throughout the website to map the site layout and allow for easy navigation back and forth through the webpages.
* Flash messages are used throughout the website to confirm successful user actions or alert the user to errors.
* Consistent and simple styling of rounded border boxes breaks each web page's information into easily digestible chunks.
* A responsive grid design ensures that the content is organised in an aesthetically pleasing and practical format on all screen sizes.

### Login
The website is intended only for RCN members and RCN staff. There is no functionality for those who do not login, therefore, the website opens on the login page to make this clear to the visitor.
A strap line is used to easily explain the purpose of the website to the user.

## Mandatory Requirements
A project violating any of these requirements will FAIL

- Data handling: Build a MongoDB-backed Flask project for a web application that allows users to store and manipulate data records about a particular domain. If you are considering using a different database, please discuss that with your mentor first and inform Student Care.
- Database structure: Put some effort into designing a database structure well-suited for your domain. Make sure to put some thought into the nesting relationships between records of different entities.
- User functionality: Create functionality for users to create, locate, display, edit and delete records (CRUD functionality).
- Use of technologies: Use HTML and custom CSS for the website's front-end.
- Structure: Incorporate a main navigation menu and structured layout (you might want to use Materialize or Bootstrap to accomplish this).
- Documentation: Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the value that it provides to its users.
- Version control: Use Git & GitHub for version control.
- Attribution: Maintain clear separation between code written by you and code from external sources (e.g. libraries or tutorials). Attribute any code from external sources to its source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README.
- Deployment: Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as Heroku.
- Make sure to not include any passwords or secret keys in the project repository.
- Important Notes - No authentication is expected for this project. The focus is on the data, rather than any business logic.
